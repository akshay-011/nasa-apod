        <h4>The Spider and the Fly</h4>
        <p>
          Will the spider ever catch the fly? Not if both are large emission
          nebulas toward the constellation of the Charioteer (Auriga). The
          spider-shaped gas cloud in the image center is actually an emission
          nebula labelled IC 417, while the smaller fly-shaped cloud on the left
          is dubbed NGC 1931 and is both an emission nebula and a reflection
          nebula. About 10,000 light-years distant, both nebulas harbor young
          star clusters. For scale, the more compact NGC 1931 (Fly) is about 10
          light-years across. The featured deep image, captured over 20 hours
          during late January in Berkshire UK, also shows more diffuse and
          red-glowing interstellar gas and dust.
